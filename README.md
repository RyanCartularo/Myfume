(Important note 1: When downloading the file your Operating System will likely mark it as a virus because of its use of a terminal, its not a virus I promise :), but of course if you don't believe me don't download this most excellect program ;))

(Important note 2: When downloaded the program will not be able to connect to the database because the database is only on the device of the creator)
